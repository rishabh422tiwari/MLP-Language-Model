# MLP-Language-Model
Building a Character level language model with the notion of Multi Layer Perceptron given in the paper "A Neural Probabilistic Language Model by Yoshua Bengio 2003.

Bengio et al. 2003 MLP language model paper (pdf): https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf

Dataset consists of name like example and we will train our model generate words which looks as much as like names.
